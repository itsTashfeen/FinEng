## Guiding Principles
- **Model First:** The alpha is the accuracy of modeling, not execution speed. Python is sufficient.
- **Test Exhaustively:** Rigorous backtesting validated in live environment before risking capital.
- **Fail Fast:** Kill the project early if fundamental edge doesn't exist.
- **Risk Obsessed:** Preserve capital above all else.

## Phase 0: Feasibility Study & Strategy Validation

**Objective:** Determine if exploitable pricing inefficiencies exist before investing months in infrastructure.

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks

**Language/Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebooks, Excel/Google Sheets

### 0.1: Market Research & Data Availability
-   [ ] **Polymarket API Verification:**
    -   Confirm historical data availability (prices, volumes, resolutions) at required granularity
    -   Test real-time WebSocket feeds for live data
    -   Verify order book snapshot availability (depth, spread data)
    -   Document API rate limits and restrictions
    -   Check for any data access costs

-   [ ] **Academic Research:**
    -   Review literature on prediction market efficiency
    -   Study papers on short-term binary option pricing
    -   Research crypto microstructure at sub-hourly timeframes
    -   Document findings on market efficiency challenges

-   [ ] **Competitive Landscape:**
    -   Identify if other sophisticated traders are active in these markets
    -   Analyze typical bid-ask spreads and liquidity depth
    -   Document market maker behavior patterns

### 0.2: Manual Strategy Validation
-   [ ] **Sample Data Collection:**
    -   Collect data for 100-200 historical 15-minute BTC binary option markets
    -   Gather corresponding spot price data from major exchange (Coinbase, Binance)
    -   Document exact timestamps, final resolutions, and market prices

-   [ ] **Simple Theoretical Pricing:**
    -   For each market, calculate basic theoretical probability using:
        - Recent realized volatility (last 1-hour, 4-hour, 24-hour)
        - Simple momentum indicators (last 5-min, 10-min returns)
        - Black-Scholes as baseline (knowing its limitations)
    -   Compare theoretical prices to actual market prices

-   [ ] **Profitability Analysis:**
    -   Create spreadsheet model with realistic assumptions:
        - Entry at market price + slippage (estimate 0.5-2%)
        - Exchange fees (typically 2-5% on prediction markets)
        - Required edge threshold (minimum 5% mispricing to trade)
    -   Calculate hypothetical PnL for each of the 100 sample trades
    -   Compute win rate, average profit per trade, maximum drawdown

-   [ ] **Liquidity & Market Impact Assessment:**
    -   Analyze historical order book depth
    -   Estimate realistic position sizes given typical liquidity
    -   Calculate potential market impact for target trade sizes
    -   Document how bid-ask spread varies by time-of-day

### 0.3: Go/No-Go Decision

**Success Criteria:**
- Manual analysis shows positive expected value after all costs on >50% of test cases
- Sufficient liquidity exists for minimum viable trade sizes ($100-500 per position)
- Data access is reliable and cost-effective
- Mispricings >7% occur frequently enough (at least 5-10 opportunities per day)

**Decision Point:** 
-  **GO**: Proceed to Phase 1 if criteria are met
- **NO-GO**: Pivot to different strategy or market if edge doesn't exist

    -   Calibrate probabilities using isotonic regression or Platt scaling

### 1.3: High-Dimensional Feature Space Management

**Problem:** Feature set could be 50-200 features, risking overfitting and computational issues.

    - Position sizing: Start with fixed size, later implement dynamic
    - Direction: Buy underpriced side, sell overpriced side
    
    **Execution Modeling:**
    - Entry slippage: Model as % of bid-ask spread + fixed bps
    - Fill probability: Not all orders fill (especially in low liquidity)
    - Entry delay: Add realistic latency (100-500ms from signal to fill)
    - Partial fills: Model scenarios where only portion of order fills
    
    **Exit Modeling:**
    - Automatic at T+15 resolution
    - Final PnL: (Resolution_price - Entry_price) * Position_size

        - Include exchange fees (maker/taker)
        - Model slippage as function of order size vs. book depth
        - Add random execution jitter
    
    -   [ ] **Market impact modeling:**
        - Estimate price impact based on order size relative to typical volume
        - Implement non-linear impact (larger orders have disproportionate impact)
    
    -   [ ] **Fill simulation:**
        - Not all limit orders fill (especially in prediction markets)
        - Model fill probability based on order aggressiveness
        - Account for adverse selection (fills more likely when you're wrong)
    
    -   [ ] **Regime analysis:**
        - Tag each trade by market regime (high/low volatility, trending/ranging)
        - Analyze performance by regime

    - Conditional VaR (CVaR/Expected Shortfall)
    - Maximum consecutive losses
    - Percentage of time in drawdown
    
    **Stability analysis:**

    - Performance by market condition
    - Sensitivity to parameter changes

### 1.5: Walk-Forward Testing & Out-of-Sample Validation

-   [ ] **Walk-Forward Analysis:**

    -   Roll forward, retrain, test again
    -   Verify edge persists across all out-of-sample periods
    -   Document any performance degradation over time

-   [ ] **True Out-of-Sample Testing:**
    -   Reserve final 10-20% of data as holdout set
    -   Never used for any model development or feature selection
    -   Run final model on this data exactly once
    -   Results must match in-sample performance within confidence intervals

-   [ ] **Stress Testing:**
    -   Test performance during:
        - High volatility events (crashes, rallies)
        - Low liquidity periods (weekends, holidays)
        - Trending vs. ranging markets
        - Different volatility regimes
    -   Verify model doesn't catastrophically fail in any scenario

**Exit Criteria for Phase 1:**
-  Sharpe ratio > 1.5 on out-of-sample data
-  Maximum drawdown < 20%
-  Win rate > 52% after all costs
-  Edge is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
-  Performance stable across walk-forward periods
-  Smooth equity curve (no periods of severe underperformance)
-  Model passes stress tests in various market regimes

**Decision Point:** Only proceed to Phase 2 if ALL criteria are met.

## Phase 3: Live Deployment & Risk Management

**Objective:** Deploy with real capital while maintaining strict risk controls. Validate end-to-end system with money on the line.

**Duration:** 3-6 months to fully validate

**Language/Stack:** Same as Phase 2, plus secure secrets management

### 3.1: Exchange Integration & Security

-   [ ] **API Integration:**
    -   Implement Polymarket order placement API
    -   Test on testnet/sandbox if available
    -   Order types: limit orders (primary), market orders (emergency only)
    -   Implement order status checking (filled, partially filled, cancelled)
    -   Build order cancellation logic
    -   Handle API errors gracefully (rate limits, rejections, timeouts)

-   [ ] **Order Execution Module:**
    -   Limit order placement at our calculated fair value
    -   Timeout logic (cancel if not filled within X seconds)
    -   Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
    -   Verify order confirmation before proceeding
    -   Handle partial fills appropriately
    -   Emergency market order capability (for forced exits)

-   [ ] **API Key Security:**
    -   Use environment variables or secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
    -   Never hardcode keys in source code
    -   Never commit keys to version control
    -   Restrict API key permissions (trading only, no withdrawals if possible)
    -   Implement IP whitelisting on exchange if supported
    -   Rotate keys periodically (quarterly)
    -   Monitor API key usage for anomalies

-   [ ] **Security Hardening:**
    -   Enable 2FA on exchange account
    -   Use withdrawal whitelist (only to known addresses)
    -   Set withdrawal limits
    -   Regular security audits of server
    -   Keep all software updated
    -   Use VPN or private network for server access

### 3.2: Risk Management Module

**This module has veto power over all trading decisions.**

-   [ ] **Position Sizing:**
    -   **Initial Phase:** Fixed small size ($50-100 per trade)
    -   **Later:** Implement Kelly Criterion (fractional, ~25% of Kelly)
    -   Formula: `f = (p*b - q) / b` where:
        - p = win probability
        - q = 1 - p
        - b = win/loss ratio
    -   Never bet more than 2% of capital on single trade
    -   Scale down during drawdowns

-   [ ] **Hard Limits (Non-Negotiable):**
    -   **Max loss per trade:** $50 (initially)
    -   **Max loss per day:** $200
    -   **Max loss per week:** $500
    -   **Max drawdown from peak:** 20%
    -   **Max open positions:** 5 concurrent trades
    -   **Max total exposure:** 30% of capital
    
    -   **Halt conditions:**
        - If daily limit hit → stop trading for rest of day
        - If weekly limit hit → stop trading for rest of week
        - If drawdown limit hit → stop trading, manual review required
        - If 5 consecutive losses → stop, investigate
        - If data feed fails → stop immediately

-   [ ] **Position Limits:**
    -   Maximum position size per market
    -   Maximum total exposure across all positions
    -   Concentration limits (don't over-allocate to correlated markets)

-   [ ] **Correlation Monitoring:**
    -   Track correlation between consecutive trades
    -   If correlation > 0.7, reduce position sizes (likely over-trading same signal)
    -   Monitor correlation across open positions
    -   Reduce exposure if positions are too correlated (concentration risk)

-   [ ] **Drawdown-Based Scaling:**
    -   Reduce position size after losses:
        - After 10% drawdown: reduce size by 25%
        - After 15% drawdown: reduce size by 50%
        - After 20% drawdown: halt trading
    -   Increase position size slowly after recovery:
        - Require 10 consecutive profitable days before scaling up
        - Increase size by max 10% per week

-   [ ] **Sanity Checks:**
    -   Validate all prices (reject if > 5% from recent average)
    -   Check for data staleness (reject if data > 10 seconds old)
    -   Verify sufficient liquidity before trading
    -   Confirm model confidence above minimum threshold
    -   Check for reasonable edge size (reject if > 30%, likely data error)

-   [ ] **Circuit Breakers:**
    -   Unusual market conditions:
        - BTC moves > 10% in 15 minutes → halt trading
        - Polymarket spreads > 10% → reduce activity
        - Exchange API errors > 5 in 1 hour → halt and investigate
    -   System issues:
        - Model inference time > 1 second → halt
        - Database query time > 500ms → investigate, may halt
        - Memory usage > 90% → restart, investigate

-   [ ] **Rate Limits:**
    -   Respect exchange API rate limits
    -   Implement client-side rate limiting (stay under limits)
    -   Exponential backoff on rate limit errors
    -   Queue orders if approaching limits

### 3.3: Phased Capital Deployment

-   [ ] **Micro Phase (Week 1-2):**
    -   Deploy with $500-1000 (amount you can lose without stress)
    -   Position size: $50-100 per trade
    -   Goal: Verify entire system works end-to-end with real money
    -   Expect to pay "tuition" learning real-world gotchas
    -   Obsessively monitor every trade

-   [ ] **Small Phase (Week 3-8):**
    -   If Micro Phase successful, increase capital to $2,000-5,000
    -   Position size: $100-200 per trade
    -   Goal: Accumulate 100+ real trades for statistical analysis
    -   Continue monitoring closely, but some automation acceptable
    -   Validate performance matches paper trading and backtest

-   [ ] **Medium Phase (Month 3-6):**
    -   If Small Phase shows consistent profitability, increase to $10,000-20,000
    -   Position size: $200-500 per trade
    -   Implement dynamic sizing (Kelly-based)
    -   Monitor weekly instead of trade-by-trade
    -   Begin optimizing for efficiency, not just validation

-   [ ] **Scaling Decision:**
    -   Only scale beyond Medium Phase if:
        - 6+ months of profitable live trading
        - Real Sharpe ratio > 1.0
        - Drawdowns contained within limits
        - Deep understanding of all failure modes
        - Confidence in long-term edge sustainability

### 3.4: Performance Reconciliation & Analysis

-   [ ] **Daily Reconciliation:**
    -   Compare actual PnL to expected PnL
    -   Verify all trades executed as intended
    -   Account for every dollar of discrepancy:
        - Fees (expected vs. actual)
        - Slippage (expected vs. actual)
        - Execution delays (signal to fill time)
        - Partial fills or missed trades
    -   Document patterns in discrepancies

-   [ ] **Weekly Performance Review:**
    -   Generate comprehensive report:
        - Total PnL (realized and unrealized)
        - Trade count, win rate, profit factor
        - Sharpe ratio (rolling)
        - Maximum drawdown from peak
        - Comparison to backtest expectations
        - Comparison to paper trading results
    -   Investigate any anomalies
    -   Update forecasts and expectations

-   [ ] **Trade Post-Mortems:**
    -   Analyze losing trades:
        - Was model wrong about probability?
        - Was market wrong initially but corrected?
        - Did new information arrive mid-trade?
        - Was execution poor (slippage, delay)?
    -   Analyze winning trades:
        - Was win due to model skill or luck?
        - How confident was model?
        - Could sizing have been better?
    -   Document lessons learned

-   [ ] **Continuous Validation:**
    -   Is edge degrading over time?
    -   Are market conditions changing?
    -   Are competitors adapting?
    -   Is liquidity decreasing?
    -   Do we need to retrain models?

### 3.5: Operational Procedures

## Phase 4: Optimization & Scaling

**Objective:** Continuously improve system performance, adapt to changing markets, and explore advanced strategies.

**Duration:** Ongoing

### 4.1: Performance Optimization

-   [ ] **Trade-Level Analysis:**
    -   Build analytics database from all executed trades
    -   Identify patterns in winners vs. losers:
        - Time of day effects
        - Volatility regime dependencies
        - Edge size correlations
        - Market condition indicators
    -   Find conditions where model performs best/worst
    -   Adjust filters to avoid poor-performing scenarios

-   [ ] **Model Refinement:**
    -   Retrain models monthly with new data
    -   Test new features based on live trading insights
    -   Implement ensemble methods (combine Model A and Model B)
    -   Explore alternative model architectures:
        - LSTM/GRU for sequential patterns
        - Attention mechanisms
        - Online learning (model adapts in real-time)
    -   Validate all changes with walk-forward testing before deployment

-   [ ] **Feature Engineering v2:**
    -   Market microstructure features (if you find access to better data)
    -   Alternative data sources:
        - Social sentiment (Twitter, Reddit)
        - News sentiment
        - Blockchain metrics (on-chain data)
        - Options flow from other markets
    -   Cross-market features (correlations with traditional markets)

-   [ ] **Execution Optimization:**
    -   Analyze fill rates and slippage patterns
    -   Optimize order placement (limit vs. market, timing)
    -   Reduce latency where beneficial (but see latency analysis below)
    -   Smart order routing if multiple venues available

### 4.2: Latency Analysis & Infrastructure Decisions

**Critical Question:** Is Python's latency actually costing you money?

-   [ ] **Latency Audit:**
    -   Measure end-to-end latency components:
        - Data receipt: X ms
        - Feature calculation: Y ms
        - Model inference: Z ms
        - Order placement: W ms
        - Total: X+Y+Z+W ms
    -   Compare to competition (market maker response times)
    -   Analyze trade outcomes by latency:
        - Do faster executions have better PnL?
        - Is slippage correlated with execution delay?

-   [ ] **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    -   Estimate profit loss due to latency (if any)
    -   Compare to cost of optimization:
        - Developer time (your time is valuable)
        - Rewrite complexity and maintenance burden
        - Potential for new bugs
    -   **Decision rule:** Only optimize if latency losses > $5,000/month

-   [ ] **Incremental Optimization (if needed):**
    -   **Before C++/Rust:** Try these Python optimizations:
        1. **Numba JIT compilation:** Compile critical functions to machine code
        2. **Cython:** Compile Python to C for speed
        3. **Vectorization:** Use NumPy/Pandas operations (already fast)
        4. **Async I/O:** Non-blocking network operations
        5. **Multiprocessing:** Parallel feature calculation
        6. **Code profiling:** Find actual bottlenecks (usually not where you think)
    -   Measure improvement after each optimization
    -   Goal: 10x speedup possible with Python optimizations

-   [ ] **Microservice Architecture (if truly needed):**
    -   **Only if:** Proven latency losses > $10k/month AND Python optimization insufficient
    -   **Strategy:** 
        - Keep Python for: data analysis, model training, strategy logic, monitoring
        - Rewrite only: order execution module in C++/Rust
        - Communicate via gRPC or shared memory
    -   **Reality check:** 15-minute options are NOT latency sensitive. If you need this, you're likely in wrong market.

### 4.3: Strategy Enhancement

    -   Agent learns optimal policy (when to trade, how much)
    -   Reward function based on risk-adjusted returns
    -   Explore PPO, A3C, or similar algorithms
    -   Extremely data-intensive and compute-intensive

    -   Social media sentiment
    -   Google trends
    -   Blockchain metrics
    -   Validate that data actually adds value (most doesn't)

### 4.5: Risk Management Evolution

-   [ ] **VaR and CVaR Models:**
    -   Estimate Value at Risk for portfolio
    -   Use Monte Carlo simulation
    -   Stress testing under extreme scenarios
    -   Set position limits based on VaR

-   [ ] **Scenario Analysis:**
    -   What if volatility doubles?
    -   What if liquidity dries up?
    -   What if edge disappears?
    -   What if exchange has issues?
    -   Build contingency plans

-   [ ] **Diversification:**
    -   Multiple strategies (lower correlation)
    -   Multiple markets
    -   Multiple time frames

## Critical Success Factors

### What Makes This Strategy Work (or Not)

**Essential Requirements:**
1. **Edge Existence:** Polymarket binary options must be systematically mispriced
2. **Edge Persistence:** Mispricing must persist long enough to be exploitable
3. **Sufficient Liquidity:** Must be able to enter/exit positions at reasonable cost
4. **Model Accuracy:** Your probability estimates must be more accurate than market's
5. **Execution Quality:** Must capture edge after all costs (fees, slippage)

**Red Flags to Watch:**
-  Edge degrading over time (market becoming more efficient)
-  Liquidity drying up (spreads widening, volume decreasing)
- ️ Increasing competition (faster market maker responses)
- ️ Model performance degrading (regime change market hasn't adapted to)
- ️ Execution quality declining (more slippage, missed fills)

**Kill Criteria (Shut Down Strategy):**
-  3 consecutive months of losses
-  Sharpe ratio < 0.5 for 6+ months
-  Edge decreased by > 50% from peak
-  Cannot maintain profitability even with optimization
-  Market structure changed fundamentally
-  Better opportunities identified elsewhere

## Final Thoughts

This roadmap is **comprehensive but realistic**. The key insights:

1. **Validate the edge exists BEFORE building infrastructure** (Phase 0)
2. **Backtest rigorously** with realistic costs and constraints (Phase 1)
3. **Paper trade extensively** to validate in real-time (Phase 2)
4. **Start tiny** with real capital and scale gradually (Phase 3)
5. **Continuously adapt** and improve (Phase 4)

Most importantly: **Be honest with yourself.** If the edge doesn't exist, doesn't persist, or can't be captured after costs, move on. Not every strategy works, and that's okay. The quant trading graveyard is full of strategies that looked great in backtest but failed in reality.

**Success probability:** If you execute this roadmap rigorously, you have a ~20-30% chance of building a sustainably profitable system. Those are honest odds. Most attempts fail, but the learning is valuable regardless.

**Good luck, and may your Sharpe ratio be high and your drawdowns low.**
