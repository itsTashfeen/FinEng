\section{Introduction}

This document analyzes the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of a simple coin-flipping game. The simulation visualizes the potential outcomes and profit distributions of the game. The generated plot is included and centered in the following section.

\section{Simulation Results}

The figure below illustrates the outcomes of the simulation. The top plot shows the cumulative profit over a series of flips, while the bottom plot shows a histogram of the final profits from all simulations.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coin_simulation}, the simulation provides valuable insights into the risk and reward of the game. This visualization is key to understanding the range of possible outcomes.
